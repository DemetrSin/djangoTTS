In this example, the validators argument is used to specify a list of validation functions for the text field. The MaxLengthValidator is applied with a limit_value of 1000, ensuring that the text input does not exceed 1000 characters. Additionally, a Textarea widget is used to create a multi-line input field for better user experience when entering longer texts. Adjust the widget's attributes as needed for your specific UI requirements.
